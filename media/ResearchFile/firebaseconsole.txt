-to start with this firebase  database, we can directly go with console.firebase.google.com
first we'll open browser and type console,firebase.google.com
then we will add our new project, i'll name it library sys. just click next, next 
and now select an account. so pwede tayong mag select ng existing account or
create new account.
then after creating our project we can either build firestore or real-time
databse


-by default we can't read and write in our db  so all we have to do is to edit 
rules and set our read and write key to true.then click on publish.now that the 
rules is changed we can 

-so we have to remember that in firebase we are not using scheama, we are not 
storing data in a form of table. instead we store data in a form of json 
format where we can have nodes and series of key. the parent key and the
child key where the child key is the primary key in the parent key.
so para mas maintidihan natin lets's do this in our 


by this way we can add the data into our database, here we
have ids for particula object so and equavalent nito sa sql is primary key and
below our object or childkey we have key value pair or in sql pa we call this
attributes.


insert data- we use the firebase SDK, we first grab the  database object
then we create a reference to where wenna save the data. in this case where
creating a ref to the users location. and we will specify if anong
primary key or child key natin i sasave yung data.

const db = firebase.database();
const customers = db.ref().child("users");
const primaryKey = "user_one";

customers.child(primaryKey).set({
"firstname" : "maimah",
"lastname" : "dangco",
"location" : "PLH"

});


-so how do we provide relation on our collection?


{ 
   "users" : 
   {
      "user_one":
	{
         "firstname" : "omaimah",
         "lastname" : "dangco",
         "location" : "PLH"


	},
	"user_two":
	{
          "firstname" : "lanz",
         "lastname" : "lozaldo",
         "location" : "3rd street"

	}
   }, 
   "events" :
   {
     "event_one" :
      {
       "name" : "CICS Gala",
       "date" : 20230866
      },
      "event_two" :
      {
        "name" : "Foundation Day",
       "date" : 20230866
      }
 
   },
  
 "eventAtendees" :
   {
     "event_one" :
      {
       "user_one" : "omaimah",
       "user_two" :  "lanz"
      }
       
   }
  

}

atendees is key that relates users to event keys, what creates this relation is called foreign key.
